# Project Layout
The system is composed of three main parts: webcam, Zedboard and monitor. This parts are connected all together to perform video capturing, filtering and show the results on a monitor via VGA. A switch, the first of the FPGA board, is used to choose which image to display, between the original greyscale image and the filtered image. </br>

![Diagram](readm_img/HighLevelDescription.png) </br>

The project layout is pretty straightforward: Webcam data is captured by the processor through the v4l2 kernel running on PetaLinux. Data saved in memory is then transferred to Programmable Logic (PL) through the use of DMA on an AXI-Stream bus. Finally, the FPGA architecture processes the image, managing the format and applying a Sobel filter to then drive the VGA to display the video. </br>

<a name="startlist"></a>
# Getting Started
The following steps are needed to make the system work:
- with a tool like gparted, divide the SD card in three different partitions: a 4MB free space at the beginning, a 500MB FAT32 partition as BOOT and the remaining part in ext4 as rootfs;
- from the petalinux_files/ directory, copy the BOOT.BIN, boot.scr and image.ub files in the BOOT partition and from this [link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1RzFJCgQ1HQrXdmVkEm8N4Z-CmbkjK4yV?usp=sharing) unzip the rootfs.tar.gz in the rootfs partition;
- insert the SD card in the Zedboard, and connect it wih a computer via the COM connection;
- connect the Webcam and the monitor to the Zedboard;
- in the PetaLinux terminal run the commands <code>sh load_hw.sh</code> and <code>sh start.sh</code> and the system should start;
- you might have to use the last switch on the Zedboard to set the right video visualization, depending on the video encoding of our Webcam.

# Project steps
The following part explains our steps to develop the system from scratch.
## Vivado Hardware Design
![Diagram](readm_img/Block_Diagram.png) </br>
The diagram shows the architecture we have developed where we can identify the main blocks:
- ZYNQ processor (*processing_system7_0*);
- Axi DMA (*axi_dma_0*);
- image processing block composed of receive dma (*recive_dma_0*) and sobel filter (*SobelFilter_0*); 
- image visualization block composed of frame generator (*frame_generator_0*) and vga driver (*vga_0*);
- memory blocks (*blk_mem_gen_0, blk_mem_gen_1, blk_mem_gen_2*).

The data flow starts from the **processor** which via embedded code handles the dma and transfers the image via AXI-Stream to the **receive dma** block.  Here the data is converted from the YUY2 webcam format to 4 bits greyscale. Then the image is saved and passed to the next block that implements the **Sobel filter**, the image processing core that through an algorithm manages to highlight the edges of a figure within the image. Finally, the frame generator block is responsible for creating the frame to be sent to the VGA driver after applying a frame that indicates the recognition of a figure, handling synchronization. </br>

Three memory blocks necessary to save partial results after each processing are provided in the architecture so as to simplify synchronization and management of the image shown on the screen. To avoid concurrency problems between the "SobelFilter" block and "FrameGenerator" block, Memory Block 2 is added, allowing access to the original image at any time. <\br>

### Receive Dma block
This block handles the format of the incoming data from the dma. On input we get a 32 bits data which corresponds to two pixels encoded in YUY2. From this bit array the two bytes related to brightness are extracted where only the most significant 4 bits of each byte are actually transferred. To handle the different order of the input bytes due to variations in the image format, a switch has been added to allow the choice between two different configurations. Data is then passed out in groups of two pixels encoded in greyscale 4 bits (one byte). </br>

### Sobel filter
This is the block designated to implement the Sobel filter. Two 3Ã—3 kernels, that is, two convolution matrices, are applied to the original image to compute approximate values of the horizontal and vertical gradients. From the original image, 2 rows are stored in 2 arrays, and a third array is used to store an additional 3 pixels. In this way, by simply shifting the three arrays by one pixel, one always manages to have in the first three array positions the correct pixels on which to apply the kernel.
Again the image is stored in a BRAM for the next step.

### Frame generator block
In this block the partial sums of the filtered image are calculated and used to estimate the box in which the figure is contained. The partial sums of each row and column are saved in two arrays. The index of the two largest values in each array will indicate the boundary rows and columns of the figure, on which to then plot the box.
Timing for frame generation in sync with the VGA driver is also handled, which using the "on state" signal enables or disables image transmission.

## Petalinux build
The following steps must be carried out on a Linux (we used Ubuntu 16.04) computer. 
- Install PetaLinux Tools;
- inside the project directory run <code>petalinux-create --type project --template zynq --name \<PROJECT NAME\></code> to create the PetaLinux project;
- run <code>petalinux-config --get-hw-description \<PATH TO XSA FILE\></code> with the path to the .xsa file generated by Vivado;
- GUARDARE PETALINUX CONFIG 
 
- generate the PetaLinux image with <code>petalinux-build -c device-tree</code> and <code>petalinux-build</code>;
- use <code>petalinux-package --boot --format BIN --fsbl images/linux/zynq_fsbl.elf --fpga images/linux/BOOT.bit --u-boot</code> to generate the BOOT.BIN file.
 
 for more detailed instructions follow LINK A GUIDA <\br>
 
## Code for Zynq processor
The acquisition and transfer of the image into the PS are handled by the "webcam_to_PL.c" code. Through the use of the v4l2 kernel, the processor interfaces with the webcam by managing its registers and buffers and then transfers the acquired data to the PL by driving the DMA driver.
The code is run on PetaLinux, a Linux-based operating system for embedded systems, which is necessary to take advantage of the capabilities of the v4l2 kernel. However, this involves adding an abstraction layer that complicates memory address management and communication with the PL.
The code we implemented takes inspiration from two different examples found online, "capture.c"[link] for the proper use of v4l2 and "dmatest.c"[link] for the DMA driver, which we have included in this directory. <\br>
Next are some sections of code that play an important role in the operation of the system. <\br>

 
### transfer_dma()
In this section we deal with data transfer via DMA. Data is divided into N blocks of size equal to "transfer_lenght," defined by choosing a value smaller than the max transfer lenght of the DMA (equal to 16384) and that divide the image into an integer N number. 
N transfers are then performed for each frame.

```
void transfer_dma(volatile unsigned int *dma_virtual_addr, unsigned int phisical_address, unsigned int size){
    // divide image in N blocks to stream less than maximum bytes number
    int i = 0;
    int N = (int)(size/transfer_lenght);

    for(i=0; i<N; i++){
        //  Halt the DMA
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_CONTROL_REGISTER, HALT_DMA);

        //  Writing source address of the data from MM2S in DDR
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_SRC_ADDRESS_REGISTER, (phisical_address+(i*transfert_lenght)));

        //  Run the MM2S channel
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_CONTROL_REGISTER, RUN_DMA);

        //  Writing MM2S transfer length of transfert_lenght  bytes
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_TRNSFR_LENGTH_REGISTER, transfert_lenght);

        //  Waiting for MM2S synchronization
        dma_mm2s_sync(dma_virtual_addr);
    }
}
```
                  
### initdma()
This function initializes the DMA and takes care of mapping via "mmap()" the control registers and the memory area used for data transfer.
In order to access the physical addresses of the memory, we use /dev/mem to create a "file descriptor" that allows the memory to be accessed from PetaLinux.
We then map the physical addresses of the DMA given in Vivado's "Address Editor" so they can be used by our application.
```
void initdma(){
        printf("Running DMA transfer.\n");

        //  Opening a character device file of the Zynq's DDR memory with aligned page
        int ddr_memory = open("/dev/mem", O_RDWR | O_SYNC);
        unsigned pagesize = sysconf(_SC_PAGESIZE);

        //  Memory map the address of the DMA AXI IP via its AXI lite control interface register block
        dma_virtual_addr = mmap(NULL, pagesize, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, ddr_memory, 0x40400000);

        //  Memory map the MM2S source address register block
        virtual_src_addr  = mmap(NULL, imageSize*2, PROT_READ | PROT_WRITE, MAP_SHARED, ddr_memory, 0x0e000000);

        //  Reset the DMA
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_CONTROL_REGISTER, RESET_DMA);

        //  Halt the DMA
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_CONTROL_REGISTER, HALT_DMA);

        //  Enable all interrupts
        write_dma(dma_virtual_addr, MM2S_CONTROL_REGISTER, ENABLE_ALL_IRQ);
}
```
                 
### process_image()
"process_image" is the main function for code operation. In this part of the code we copy data from the webcam registers, previously mapped in memory, to the memory locations used for transfer mapped in the "init_dma()" function. 
We point out the use of the "volatile" attribute to prevent the compiler from optimizing the use of memory allocated for saving the image.
```
static void process_image(volatile const void *p, int size){
    int i = 0;
    int j = size/4;

        for (i = 0; i < j; i++){
            virtual_src_addr[i] = *(((volatile unsigned int *)p)+i);
        }
        transfer_dma(dma_virtual_addr, DMA_SRC_ADDRESS, size);
}        
```
